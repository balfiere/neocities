<p>Released in 2020, <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a note taking app most notable for its support of wiki style links between notes and wide range of user plugins. I first started using Obsidian in early 2022 as a way to organize my notes for learning Thai. The ability to link between notes and create your own sort of wiki appealed to me since I was struggling to learn Thai grammar. There aren’t any reference websites for Thai where you can easily search for explanations on grammar points with examples like <a href="https://bunpro.jp/">Bunpro</a> and <a href="https://imabi.org/">Imabi</a> or more general guides like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/edit">Cure Dolly</a> and <a href="https://sakubi.neocities.org/">Sakubi</a> for Japanese. Frankly most Thai learners will tell you that Thai has no grammar (I hope I don’t have to explain why this is clearly stupid) and once you learn the very basics that are taught in most intro to Thai books you’re basically home free. But when I was struggling to understand why a simple sentence like พวกเขาไม่ชอบไปไหน (they don’t like to go anywhere) is a statement and not a question despite using the interrogative pronoun ไหน, not being able to find an explanation in a grammar book, and only managing to find an answer I could understand in an academic journal article of all places (if you’re curious, the answer is that pronouns cannot be interrogative when they’re the object of a negative predicate, in this case they become indefinite – basically the presence of ไม่ ‘not’ means that ไหน doesn’t mean ‘where?’ but ‘anywhere’ instead. <a href="https://digital.car.chula.ac.th/manusya/vol6/iss2/5/">source</a>), I realized I needed a way to take notes from these different sources and make them easy to find. It’s possible I could’ve found the answer in one of the more advanced Thai grammar books and not needed to look through academic literature, but since none of those books have ebook versions and only exist online as scanned pdfs (the only Thai grammar book I know of that has an ebook version, <strong>Thai: An Essential Grammar</strong> by David Smyth, is useful for beginners but didn’t have any information on the case I outlined above), I didn’t have an easy way to look through them. I decided to use Obsidian to convert information from these books plus random blogs, podcasts, and YouTube videos written by Thai teachers to build a personal wiki.</p>

<p>When I learned about Obsidian I invariably read a lot about note taking and personal knowledge management like <a href="https://learntrepreneurs.com/books-reading-better-learning-more/zettelkastens-3-note-taking-levels-help-you-harvest-your-thoughts/">the Zettelkasten method</a> and Andy Matuschak’s concept of <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen notes</a>. While I think such systems are best suited to doing original research in an area of expertise and a bit overkill for learning about an existing domain, I do think atomic notes that are densely linked approximate the structure of how I learn and understand grammar well. So when I originally began using Obsidian I essentially imported the entirety of the Smyth book mentioned above by splitting it into a bunch of notes, one for each header. The note for each chapter I treated as a “MOC” (aka a <a href="https://obsidian.rocks/maps-of-content-effortless-organization-for-notes/">Map of Content</a>), with each main heading of a chapter turned into what I called a “permanent” note and each subheading under those an “idea” note.</p>
<p>Since Thai is a highly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language">isolating</a> language with many words that have multiple meanings and grammatical functions (for example, มา can literally mean “to come” but be used as a verb aspect marker, a directional auxiliary verb, can be used to emphasize other words, and can even be a name), I found it helpful to separate my grammar notes into two levels. For example, I have a “permanent” note for the word ให้ “to give”, which links to all my “idea” notes where I explain a single function that ให้ can have. Every time I learn something new that the word ให้ can do, I write that singular idea down and link it to the permanent note called ให้. Since the title of the permanent note is just a single word, it’s easy to remember to throw in an inline link somewhere when I make an idea note. Even if I don’t remember to go to the permanent note and add a link to the idea note I just made, it’s still easy to find since Obsidian has a feature that automatically lists all the backlinks to that file.</p>
<p>Each MOC is a part of speech, so I have one for verbs, one for conjunctions, one for nouns, etc. In my vault each MOC is an automatically generated list of notes that have a tag with that part of speech. So for example my permanent note for ให้ appears in both the verb MOC and preposition MOC since ให้ can function as both, but my idea note where I explain how ให้ expresses the idea of doing something for someone is only tagged as a preposition so it doesn’t appear in the verb MOC. I honestly don’t traverse my notes through the MOCs very often but they’re so easy to make that I don’t see a reason to not keep them in my vault.</p>
<h3 id="literature-notes" tabindex="-1">Literature notes <a class="anchor-link" href="#literature-notes"><img src="/posts/link.svg"></a></h3>
<p>My earliest literature notes were essentially copies of random blog posts and video or podcast transcripts written by Thai teachers or people who had been learning Thai for a long time. These sorts of posts were usually short and focused on explaining a single aspect of grammar they believed Thai students often struggled with.</p>
<p>Eventually when I started watching more native content I also started using Obsidian to store notes containing the entire transcript of videos I watched that had subtitles so I could build my own corpus of Thai sentences. I find this useful for understanding modern slang and other words that come up that are used colloquially a bit differently than their dictionary definition. Sometimes when I learn a word (or more often a new meaning of a word I already know) I like to use Omnisearch to find other instances of that word in my vault and see if maybe I’ve already come across it in</p>
<h3 id="modules" tabindex="-1">Modules <a class="anchor-link" href="#modules"><img src="/posts/link.svg"></a></h3>
<p>Using the Kanban plug-in I occasionally create what I call “modules” in Obsidian. These help me keep track of my progress in things like textbooks. Basically every column is a chapter and every checkbox in the column is an activity of that chapter – read the grammar section, make Anki cards, read the dialogue, answer the comprehension questions, etc.</p>
<h3 id="daily-notes" tabindex="-1">Daily notes <a class="anchor-link" href="#daily-notes"><img src="/posts/link.svg"></a></h3>
<p>I mainly use daily notes to organize my to-dos. I don’t use it for recurring tasks and habit tracking anymore, although I have in the past. Currently I use Loop Habit Tracker on Android to track how much time I spend learning, how frequently I read, practice kanji, etc. The types of to-dos that I keep in Obsidian are things like “sentence mine episode 7 part 2 of [insert show here]” or “read chapter 3 of [insert book here]” or “do [insert module task here]”. I think they’re simple enough to-dos that don’t need a more powerful app like Taskade or TickTick to manage notifications, time-blocking, etc. and I can link them directly to a literature note if I end up making one.</p>

<p>(This section assumes the reader is a follower of language learning philosophies like <a href="https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html">AJATT</a>, <a href="https://refold.la/">Refold</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgdZTyVWfUhlcP3Wj__xgqWpLHV0bL_JA">ALG</a> that heavily stress consuming as much comprehensible input as possible and deemphasizing traditional language learning methods. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, or are already on board with the idea of taking notes when learning a language, just skip this section.)</p>
<p>In general I agree that taking extensive notes is not actually useful in the long run – it’s generally more efficient to just make flashcards and use spaced repetition, especially once you get the hang of writing good flashcards that can subsume your long-term notes. And I also believe that grinding out a bunch of grammar exercises isn’t an efficient way to learn grammar, that the only way to internalize grammar and utilize it in conversation is to hear and see it in context hundreds of times. But there have been so many times I felt like I was hitting a wall with my Thai, where I could know all the words in a given sentence but had no idea what it meant, that I felt like I needed a better way of learning grammar, slang, and other parts of the language I didn’t learn in a textbook and wasn’t figuring out through immersion alone so I could make my learning more comprehensible.</p>
<p>For languages that already have a ton of good, easily navigable reference material, I don’t think there is much of a benefit in building a dedicated Obsidian vault to store long-term notes. Since I started learning Japanese 8 months ago every note I’ve taken has gone straight into my Anki deck for Japanese, and every question I’ve had so far has been answered within about 10 seconds of googling or using ctrl+f in my favorite grammar guides. But if you’re also learning a less popular, poorly documented language where you’ve had to search the depths of the internet and read through poor quality scans of grammar books written in the 1950s to figure out how to say basic shit like “where don’t they like to go?” I think organizing grammar notes in a wiki style and</p>
