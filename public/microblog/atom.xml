		<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>recently i wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://userstyles.world/style/15915/neocities-no-followers-modified">stylesheet</a> for the browser extension <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">stylus</a> to hide the stats underneath the header on neocities profiles, as well as the follower/following list in the sidebar. after the implosion of federiefederi i've been reflecting a little on why i've been moving away from #socialmedia and what i want to get out of neocities. i've been trying to break out of the mindset i tend to have on other sites of obsessively checking my activity, how many likes my posts get, who does or doesn't follow me, who's popular and who isn't, etc that's been instilled in me from spending more than half my life online. in general i like the neocities activity feed and seeing people's new pages and updates, and i don't find that that affects my brain negatively, but i feel like the visible follower and view count does. so i removed it. i know it doesn't affect other people's ability to see how many people follow me or who i follow but that doesn't bother me.</p><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240421xstitch.jpg" alt="a partially finished cross stitch. a shiny umbreon from the video game series pokemon is lying down." /><img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240421eeveelution.jpg" alt="a cross stitch pattern of 8 different evolutions of eevees from the video game series pokemon lounging on a cat tower. they are all shiny variants." /><p>11.66% done vs original. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1481310191/eeveelutions-cafe-shiny-edition-pattern">pattern link</a></p><p>i #cross-stitched a little this weekend too. according to pattern keeper i'm now over 10% done with this project ðŸ¥³ i bought this pattern last july so at this rate i think i'll be done in 7 years? i randomly saw it on etsy one day and thought it was SO cute i just bought it â€“ even though i'm not a pokemon fan lmao. luckily one of my besties is a big pokemon fan so i can give it to him... if i ever finish it. maybe i should work a liiiiittle harder and try to finish it before he graduates dental school... maybe.</p></div>

			<img src="https://kwaamfan.neocities.org/microblog/images/20240413bag.jpg" alt="a blue and white crocheted bag" />
			<figcaption>i promise this is a bag and not just a triangle... <a target="_blank" href="https://www.1dogwoof.com/weekend-wanderer-mesh-bento-bag-crochet-pattern/">pattern link</a></figcaption>

			<p>i've been sick the last couple of days, but i'm starting to feel better. i #crocheted this bag with some yarn i found at a thrift store a year ago. i haven't done any fiber arts for like two months since all the windows in my house were replaced recently, so a bunch of stuff had to be packed away. now that everything's been put back i've been able to go through my fiber arts WIPs and tbh i didn't feel like doing any of them lol. i think that since it was all cold weather stuff and now that it's >70Â°F/20Â°C i just don't have the motivation to finish them right now and just wanted a quick and easy project to get back into the swing of things.</p>
			<p>while crocheting i also #read two books by <em>keigo higashino</em>, <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/582f3ad9-7138-4297-9e89-e4340573fabc">a death in tokyo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1233629b-9d0d-4c3e-afe9-a60101400de2">the final curtain</a>. i think that makes four or five books i've read by him in the past year. i always thought of myself as a fantasy girlie but idk, i've been getting really into japanese murder mysteries this year. i really like how higashino's books aren't really just about the murder mystery but more about the people surrounding the victim, the problems in society and our relationships that can drive people to murder, and how murder and death affect people and how we treat people who have recently experienced loss. i also like how in these two books we see more of kaga as a person, and i'm sad that there aren't any more books featuring detective kaga translated into english. guess that means i just have to work harder at studying japanese ðŸ˜”</p>

				<figcaption>if someone told me these two were voiced by the same guy i would've picked up piofiore ages ago</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>i also #played <b>piofiore</b> for a little bit... i've been in a bit of an otome slump since trying out and dropping virche evermore in january. so far i've only played through nicola's route (idek how i got on his route lmao). as a LI he was nice but didn't really do anything to captivate me. i liked the story though and am looking forward to the other routes, especially yang's since he shares a voice actor with tianyou zhao from the yakuza series.</p>
