    <div class="message"><p> welcome to my microblog! i wanted a place on my website where i could write about whatever i felt like, whenever i wanted, without feeling like i need to build a dedicated page around said topic. when i was thinking about how i want to present my thoughts, i went looking at how other people keep blogs on their neocities. i like <a href="https://status.cafe/">status.cafe</a> as a sort of twitter-like alternative for short thoughts, but i wanted to be able to write longer pieces plus sort posts by tags. i also felt like a more traditional blog-like framework such as <a href="https://codeberg.org/01bbl/Zonelots">zonelots</a> would put too much pressure on me to write long posts if i only want to write a couple sentences. i guess i was looking for a more tumblr-like alternative that can balance the two but without all the <a target="_blank" href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://medium.com/mental-health-and-addictions-community/the-noise-pollution-of-social-media-and-the-web-a500eccf8e0f">noise</a> that a <span class="hashtag">#socialmedia</span> platform brings. when i stumbled upon <a href="https://notabug.org/likho/microblog.py">microblog.py</a> it seemed like the perfect fit for my use case. for awhile now i've wanted to blog more about my hobbies and interests because i like looking back at my previous thoughts on what i've played, read, etc but <a target="_blank" href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes?stackedNotes=zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9">trying to write for an audience felt paralyzing to me</a>, and when i do end up sharing stuff online it's like i could feel my brain obsessing over views and likes and replies even when i knew i wasn't sharing stuff for engagement. yet it felt weird to write fandom related stuff in obsidian next to my personal notes about thai grammar and bayesian analysis and whatnot. like i love using obsidian to write notes about things i'm trying to learn, but i didn't really want to mix in the notes i write more like a diary entry to just rant or rave about stuff. i do sometimes write about it in physical journals, but i also like being able to search for things easily and embed digital content like screenshots. i think the appeal of having your own site to write about these kinds of things is that strangers can still read it, think about it, and interact with you if they really want to, but unlike social media platforms it's not like it'll appear on their feed or dashboard, inviting them to tell you your opinions are wrong <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415215649/https://mikkeneko.tumblr.com/post/169325179934/how-web-20-and-especially-tumblr-is-ruining">if they feel like it intrudes upon their space</a>. i'm also just not a social person in general despite enjoying reading other people's blogs and opinions, so not feeling like i must respond to every single rando who finds my posts makes me feel more comfortable writing more openly. it'll probably be a couple days between writing this and publishing it on my website since i still have to write the css and make sure everything works, but i look forward to trying out this format of journaling. </p></div>
