    <div class="message"><p>recently i wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://userstyles.world/style/15915/neocities-no-followers-modified">stylesheet</a> for the browser extension <a target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">stylus</a> to hide the stats underneath the header on neocities profiles, as well as the follower/following list in the sidebar. after the implosion of federiefederi i've been reflecting a little on why i've been moving away from <span class="hashtag">#social-media</span> and what i want to get out of neocities. i've been trying to break out of the mindset i tend to have on other sites of obsessively checking my activity, how many likes my posts get, who does or doesn't follow me, who's popular and who isn't, etc that's been instilled in me from spending more than half my life online. in general i like the neocities activity feed and seeing people's new pages and updates, and i don't find that that affects my brain negatively, but i feel like the visible follower and view count does. so i removed it. i know it doesn't affect other people's ability to see how many people follow me or who i follow but that doesn't bother me.</p><figure style="float: right;max-width: 100%;"><div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-left: 1em; "><img src="/microblog/images/20240421xstitch.avif" alt="a partially finished cross stitch. a shiny umbreon from the video game series pokemon is lying down." style="max-height: 350px;width: auto;max-width: 50%;object-fit: cover;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240421eeveelution.avif" alt="a cross stitch pattern of 8 different evolutions of eevees from the video game series pokemon lounging on a cat tower. they are all shiny variants." style="max-height: 350px;width: auto;max-width: 50%;object-fit: cover;flex-shrink: 0;"></div><figcaption style="clear: both;">11.66% done vs original. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1481310191/eeveelutions-cafe-shiny-edition-pattern">pattern link</a></figcaption></figure><p>i <span class="hashtag">#cross-stitched</span> a little this weekend too. according to pattern keeper i'm now over 10% done with this project ðŸ¥³ i bought this pattern last july so at this rate i think i'll be done in 7 years? i randomly saw it on etsy one day and thought it was SO cute i just bought it â€“ even though i'm not a pokemon fan lmao. luckily one of my besties is a big pokemon fan so i can give it to him... if i ever finish it. maybe i should work a liiiiittle harder and try to finish it before he graduates dental school... maybe.</p></div>
