    <div class="message"><figure style="float:right;max-width: 350px;margin-left: 1em;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240430tulips.avif" alt="red and yellow tulips starting to bloom"><figcaption>the flowers in my garden are starting to bloom</figcaption></figure><p>i made a bunch of changes to <span class="hashtag">#my-site</span> this past week, mainly stuff behind the scenes. most notably i added an <a href="/microblog/atom.xml">atom feed</a> for my microblog. i checked it with the browser extension <a target="_blank" href="https://nodetics.com/feedbro/">feedbro</a> and it looks okay i think. i also made one for updates to the rest of my site, which you can access <a href="/atom.xml">here</a>. i enabled rss autodiscovery on the main pages as well to make adding it to your rss reader a bit easier. in addition to moving to neocities, as part of my ongoing effort to curb my <span class="hashtag">#social-media</span> use i'm also trying to read more blogs, essays, and other long-form written media by subscribing to substacks and rss feeds, and i figured i may as well make it possible for others to do the same with my site. (as a side note - i recently discovered the read it later app <a href="https://omnivore.app/">omnivore</a> and it's been really helpful in actually finishing reading articles i find interesting. i know other read it later apps have existed for a long time, idk why i've been sleeping on them until now.) i restructured a bunch of stuff in the code too, mostly switching some <code>div</code>s for semantic tags and converting all jquery to vanilla javascript, so if something looks broken try hard refreshing (ctrl+f5). turns out theres so much more to web development than the random bits i hacked together from tutorials and stack overflow answers making tumblr themes in 2015... i'm not sure if my site is actually any more accessible or loads faster and i still need to test things with an actual screen reader, but i think my code is easier to read at least.</p><figure style="float:left;max-width: 500px;margin-right: 1em;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240430leifan.avif" alt="fei and lan from the video game piofiore. lan says 'We do know a little bit about drugs.
