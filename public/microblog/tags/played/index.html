    <div class="message"><figure style="float:right;max-width: 30%;margin-left: 1em;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240430tulips.avif" alt="red and yellow tulips starting to bloom"><figcaption>the flowers in my garden are starting to bloom</figcaption></figure><p>i made a bunch of changes to the site this past week, mainly stuff behind the scenes. most notably i added an <a href="/microblog/atom.xml">atom feed</a> for my microblog. i checked it with the browser extension <a target="_blank" href="https://nodetics.com/feedbro/">feedbro</a> and it looks okay i think. i also made one for updates to the rest of my site, which you can access <a href="/atom.xml">here</a>. i enabled rss autodiscovery on the main pages as well to make adding it to your rss reader a bit easier. in addition to moving to neocities, as part of my ongoing effort to curb my social media use i'm also trying to read more blogs, essays, and other long-form written media by subscribing to substacks and rss feeds, and i figured i may as well make it possible for others to do the same with my site. (as a side note - i recently discovered the read it later app <a href="https://omnivore.app/">omnivore</a> and it's been really helpful in actually finishing reading articles i find interesting. i know other read it later apps have existed for a long time, idk why i've been sleeping on them until now.) i restructured a bunch of stuff in the code too, mostly switching some <code>div</code>s for semantic tags and converting all jquery to vanilla javascript, so if something looks broken try hard refreshing (ctrl+f5). turns out theres so much more to web development than the random bits i hacked together from tutorials and stack overflow answers making tumblr themes in 2015... i'm not sure if my site is actually any more accessible or loads faster and i still need to test things with an actual screen reader, but i think my code is easier to read at least.</p><figure style="float:left;max-width: 50%;margin-right: 1em;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240430leifan.avif" alt="fei and lan from the video game piofiore. lan says 'We do know a little bit about drugs. Isn't that neat?! That's 'cause we're the Lao-Shu!'"><figcaption>honestly these 15 year olds carried yang's route</figcaption></figure><p>i think i've had some sort of ear infection for the last couple days. i was gonna go to the doctor today if i wasn't feeling any better when i woke up, but it doesn't hurt anymore so i didn't end up going. i don't know what's up with my body this past year, i usually only get sick once or twice a year but i got sick like three times this winter alone -_- i took advantage of all the time i spent this weekend lying on my side to catch up on some manga (i may or may not have been like 6 months behind on chainsaw man ðŸ™ˆ).</p><figure style="float:right;max-width: 50%;margin-left: 1em;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240430danteyang.avif" alt="dante and yang from the video game piofiore. yang says 'Acting to protect someone only increases the probability of death.'"><figcaption>sorry for talking shit about u dante u did look pretty hot here</figcaption></figure><p>i also <span class="hashtag">#played</span> some <b>piofiore</b> and managed to finish yang's and dante's routes. now yang's route definitely lived up to its notoriety in the otome community but i found his best ending a little underwhelming. i usually do bad and good endings before the best ending and i found those really thrilling (i was even a little moved at the good ending ngl... may have even shed a tear or two) but the best ending... idk. i didn't dislike it but it wasn't as fun as his other endings or nicola's best ending. i found dante a little boring too. i think he kinda got shafted by having to carry the plot of the game on his route lol. i was grateful to finally learn about the key maiden stuff but honestly i spent the first half wishing i could've romanced leo instead. i'm halfway done with this game now and am looking forward to gilbert's route especially. orlock isn't really the type of LI i usually like but i'm also really intrigued by his role in the plot especially after seeing... yang's? best ending epilogue and dante's best ending.</p></div>
