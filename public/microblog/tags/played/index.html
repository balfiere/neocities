    <div class="message"><p style="text-indent:0;"> <span class="hashtag">#languagelearning</span> <span class="hashtag">#played</span> <span class="hashtag">#japanese</span> </p><p>have any other language learners noticed just how much ai has infiltrated language learning spaces… i feel like i'm probably beating a dead horse here bc damn near everybody in this neighborhood of the internet doesn't agree with genAI, but i've gotten so used to others sharing my convictions that every time i wander outside this bubble i'm always shocked at how much some people use it. and not just use it — <em>trust</em> it! and not just for asking it to translate an idiom or slang not found in dictionaries here and there. i've seen people unironically suggesting others use chatgpt and other llms to:</p><ul><li>generate an entire anki deck</li><li>generate short stories to read</li><li>have written or spoken practice conversations</li><li>translate and break down entire passages (before attempting to read it themselves and only asking for help on parts they don't understand)</li><li>generate example sentences for a target word or phrase that they found in their immersion or in the wild to add to their anki deck (instead of just… adding the original native sentence they found the word in……)</li></ul><p>and the damn apps… i swear every other day i see someone advertising their new language learning app that's basically just chatgpt/claude/gemini etc w a custom prompt. now i'm not a software dev so i may be misunderstanding something but… what's the point.</p><p>really, what's the point of using llms so extensively to learn a language. it all just seems so inefficient. like after spending 15 minutes setting up yomitan or goldendict i can look up a word or phrase in multiple different dictionaries before chatgpt even loads, then if i so choose add them to my anki deck with the original context and native audio in the time it would take to prompt chatgpt for a definition. on top of that llms love making shit up so u still need to fact check it, by checking a dictionary, asking a native speaker, etc. and it's like at that point why go through the bother of generating cards in the first place? but still i see people swear up and down that the text llms produce are correct and error free. well i'm happy ur so confident in ur own ability to assess bullshit in ur target language (not that they actually can), but the beginners u keep suggesting ur methods to aren't going to know how to. and even when it is technically correct, when i've tested llms in thai to see where these people are coming from, it just fails to produce the idiomatic, slang-filled, sometimes messy but still authentic speech.</p><p>and that's really my biggest issue with all this. i always thought the whole reason to learn a new language was to understand people. humans. who make art and write stories and fight and cry and laugh together. to connect to people who may be from a different culture but who still understand our shared humanity. the joy of learning a language is gaining access to the thoughts and feelings of a whole new group of people u couldn't before, to hear their stories… why waste what precious time we have on this earth reading the words of a mere facsimile? what's the point of learning a language if most of ur time with it is a version processed by a machine and not the version of it that lives and breathes in this world? i think these people are going to be in for a rude awakening call when they try to interact with their target language outside of the english-ified slop their favorite llm feeds them and the pleasantries exchanged with the waitress at their local cafe. if these people want to hinder their own ability to understand the authentic speech of their target language in the long run then so be it, but it kills me to think that a beginner might follow their advice or download an app that's just ai in disguise without really thinking about the implications of it.</p><p>rant aside… in other news i started my first otome game in japanese, <b>ayakashi gohan</b>. i've played a couple other, shorter visual novels in japanese but this is the first otome game and first what i would personally consider "full length" (30-40+ hrs native speed) VN. i was gonna wait to post my thoughts on it until after i finished but i had the biggest jump scare playing this game that i just HAD to post about: kuroda takaya voices one of the route antagonists.</p><figure class="large"><img src="/microblog/images/20250801ayakashigohan1.jpg" /><figcaption><audio controls preload="metadata"><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/7hlrqa.ogg" type="audio/ogg" /><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/ur5tdf.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /></audio><br />……くどい。俺はもう決めた。あの娘以外は考えられん<br/>Enough.

(mild spoilers for fated memories + 1926 below) i think i liked this sequel a little more than the first game, if only for the alternative + henri route. i love when otome games that have a lot of death in them also have an "everyone lives" route afterwards, and with the alternative route in this game i liked seeing how the LIs interact with the MC when they spend a long period of time being her friend/acquaintance before trying to get with her. especially with dante and nicola, i ended up liking them way more on their alternative route vs. their original route in the first game. legit if dante ever gave lili shooting lessons in his OG route like he does in his alternative route he probably would've ended up being my fav 😪 also i loved seeing the LIs spend more time working together since it meant more time spent bullying yang instead of trying to kill him &lt;3</p><p style="clear:both;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center; flex-flow: column wrap;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p1.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p2.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p3.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p4.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p5.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p6.opti.jpg" /></p><img src="/microblog/images/20240828cardigan.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em; max-width: 30%;" alt="a panel of a cardigan, partially knitted. the piece features many cables." /><p>this month i also worked a lot on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/folklore-cardigan-4">folklore cardigan</a>. i started this in february and had it in storage for like… 5 months… but i finally decided to get it done and now i just have the back piece left. it's the first wearable i've ever knitted and i made a lot of modifications, so hopefully it comes together alright. the yarn is from a cardigan i bought at a thrift store and unraveled, and i was worried that i wouldn't have enough yarn but i think it'll be enough. i managed to thrift and unravel two more sweaters this summer, so i'm excited to get this done and start working on the projects i have in mind for them.</p></div>

    <div class="message"><figure class="right" style="max-width: 300px;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240413bag.avif" alt="a blue and white crocheted bag"><figcaption>i promise this is a bag and not just a triangle... <a target="_blank" href="https://www.1dogwoof.com/weekend-wanderer-mesh-bento-bag-crochet-pattern/">pattern link</a></figcaption></figure><p>i've been sick the last couple of days, but i'm starting to feel better. i <span class="hashtag">#crocheted</span> this bag with some yarn i found at a thrift store a year ago. i haven't done any fiber arts for like two months since all the windows in my house were replaced recently, so a bunch of stuff had to be packed away. now that everything's been put back i've been able to go through my fiber arts WIPs and tbh i didn't feel like doing any of them lol. i think that since it was all cold weather stuff and now that it's >70°F/20°C i just don't have the motivation to finish them right now and just wanted a quick and easy project to get back into the swing of things.</p><p>while crocheting i also <span class="hashtag">#read</span> two books by <em>keigo higashino</em>, <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/582f3ad9-7138-4297-9e89-e4340573fabc">a death in tokyo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1233629b-9d0d-4c3e-afe9-a60101400de2">the final curtain</a>. i think that makes four or five books i've read by him in the past year. i always thought of myself as a fantasy girlie but idk, i've been getting really into japanese murder mysteries this year. i really like how higashino's books aren't really just about the murder mystery but more about the people surrounding the victim, the problems in society and our relationships that can drive people to murder, and how murder and death affect people and how we treat people who have recently experienced loss. i also like how in these two books we see more of kaga as a person, and i'm sad that there aren't any more books featuring detective kaga translated into english. guess that means i just have to work harder at studying japanese 😔</p><figure class="left"><img src="/microblog/images/20240414zhao.avif" alt="on the left is an image of the character yang from the video game piofiore. on the right is an image of the character tianyou zhao from the video game yakuza: like a dragon"><figcaption>if someone told me these two were voiced by the same guy i would've picked up piofiore ages ago</figcaption></figure><p>i also <span class="hashtag">#played</span> <b>piofiore</b> for a little bit... i've been in a bit of an otome slump since trying out and dropping virche evermore in january. so far i've only played through nicola's route (idek how i got on his route lmao). as a LI he was nice but didn't really do anything to captivate me. i liked the story though and am looking forward to the other routes, especially yang's since he shares a voice actor with tianyou zhao from the yakuza series.</p></div>
