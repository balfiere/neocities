Sakura looks surprised and Tomoyo has a gentle smile on her face."><p>i also read and watched the sequel <b>cardcaptor sakura: clear card</b>. even though i loved ccs as a kid i never read the sequel, probably because i was in college when the series started and wasn't into animanga at the time. luckily though the manga is finished now and i was able to binge read the whole thing ^^ i didn't really have high hopes since i don't usually care for series reboots, but i enjoyed it a lot more than i thought i would. i liked that sakura was better able to take charge of situations and leap into action, and syaoran got some moments to show off too. tomoyo and kero were just as adorable as always of course. while i think the main new character, akiho, was a little underutilized and i would've liked her more if she had a personality that wasn't the same as sakura's (i also could've used more touya and yukito tbh), i think the main mystery of <i>clear card</i> was more interesting than the original series and i like how it expanded upon some of the lore (especially around sakura's parents). i read that last year CLAMP announced a sequel to the first season after 5 years but i couldn't find any follow up. the anime had some major changes from the manga that i'm not sure how they're going to deal with in the sequel, but tbh i know i'll be happy as long as i get to see sakura and syaoran animated together again (i may have teared up when they flew together towards the end of the first season...). here are some of my favorite panels (spoiler warning):</p><p style="clear:both;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center; flex-flow: column wrap;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240615clearcard4.webp" alt="a manga cap of Sakura from the manga Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card.

(as a side note - i recently discovered the read it later app <a href="https://omnivore.app/">omnivore</a> and it's been really helpful in actually finishing reading articles i find interesting. i know other read it later apps have existed for a long time, idk why i've been sleeping on them until now.) i restructured a bunch of stuff in the code too, mostly switching some <code>div</code>s for semantic tags and converting all jquery to vanilla javascript, so if something looks broken try hard refreshing (ctrl+f5). turns out theres so much more to web development than the random bits i hacked together from tutorials and stack overflow answers making tumblr themes in 2015... i'm not sure if my site is actually any more accessible or loads faster and i still need to test things with an actual screen reader, but i think my code is easier to read at least.</p><figure style="float:left;max-width: 500px;margin-right: 1em;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240430leifan.avif" alt="fei and lan from the video game piofiore. lan says 'We do know a little bit about drugs.
