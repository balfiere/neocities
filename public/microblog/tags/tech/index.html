Oh yes. Introducing iBook. Think different.'" style="max-width: 100%;" /></li><li style="flex: calc(1144/1005);"><img src="/microblog/images/20240621charger.webp" alt="a picture of a charger used for the apple ibook. the power supply is circular and features the apple logo in the middle." style="max-width: 100%;" /></li></ul></div>
