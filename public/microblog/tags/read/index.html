    <div class="message"><p>i've now been on neocities for one month now! i think i've managed to get a lot done in one month. although i've spent most of that time thinking of what i want my site to look like and then coding it. i was inspired to join neocities because i just feel like i haven't been having fun on <span class="hashtag">#socialmedia</span> recently, and i thought i'd see if making my own website would be a more fulfilling use of my internet time. i've actually been trying to decrease the amount of time i spend online, which probably sounds stupid since i have to code this site from scratch, but it's actually been a really fun creative outlet. i like to think that if i spend more of my internet time on more fulfilling projects i'll spend less time on less fulfilling (but more instantly gratifying) activities like scrolling through social media. my main goal of making my own site was to have a place for me to dump my thoughts, but it's hard for me to write when i don't know how i want to display the information. now that the bulk of the coding is done, going forward i'll probably focus on writing stuff in my yakuza shrine and this microblog, with some updates to my toybox and resources site when i feel like it. to be honest a big drive for me to finally make an account here (i've randomly surfed through people's neocities for awhile now) was to dump all my yakuza thoughts and screenshots without annoying all my tumblr followers lmao while being able to organize stuff by game (i kinda don't like how on most social media you just make a post and that's it, it's not really conducive to building on your ideas over time) but after coding the basic layout i've barely written anything... guess that should motivate me to start my third? fourth? series playthrough so i can remember everything i want to say haha</p><img src="/microblog/images/moshimoshi.jpg" alt="the cover of the book moshi moshi by banana yoshimoto" style="float: right; padding: 1em 0 1em 1em; max-width: 50%;"><p>this week i <span class="hashtag">#read</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cab53bbd-96fc-48db-8376-adeb83a6dadd">moshi moshi</a> by <em>banana yoshimoto</em>. the only other book of hers i've read is <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fde5e557-e570-426e-a77c-b8c186714487">the premonition</a> which i didn't really like, although i liked the writing style. i don't know how to describe why i didn't like it other than it was just weird. usually i like that in a book but when i was reading that book i was like "wtf is wrong with these people" in a ðŸ¤¨ way. like the plot... idk. vibes were off. luckily <b>moshi moshi</b> gives "wtf is wrong with these people" in a much more enjoyable way. i loved the relationship between the mother and the daughter in this book. i feel like i'm sort of going through the same thing in my life, with the whole learning about your parents as adults and humans now that they don't really need to parent you anymore and how your relationships with them change because of that. i also loved the vivid description of the main characters' life and sense of community living in shimokitazawa. maybe it's just because i live in suburban america but living in a diverse urban area and being able to walk or take a taxi to all the cool places they go in the book sounds like a dream. here's a quote i really like that i think captures central themes of the healing power of food and community when you're grieving well in a few sentences:</p><blockquote><p>Weâ€™d been carrying around a sense of someone missingâ€”someone we might be able to find if only we knew where to go, then things might become clear.</p><p>We didnâ€™t cry then and there in the bistro, but the feeling of the cells in our bodies welcoming the sudden influx of nutrients was as refreshing as crying in a speeding car with the windows rolled down, letting tears fly. Like finally sitting yourself down at your destination at the end of an exhausting journey.</p><p>Michiyo-san didnâ€™t know what we were going through, nor did she console us directly. All she did was put herself into her food and offer it to us. That was obvious in everything about the restaurantâ€”everything there was as real and as certain as anything could be.</p><q>Moshi Moshi</q> by <cite>Banana Yoshimoto</cite></blockquote></div>

    <div class="message"><p>this week i <span class="hashtag">#read</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ddef3591-d299-4536-bffd-84c3ed3cfdc4">age of vice</a> by <em>deepti kapoor</em> and <a target="_blank" href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/681ebf7e-7c19-41ad-8b07-eac511dcce8b">invisible women: data bias in a world designed for men</a> by <em>caroline criado pÃ©rez</em>. the vast majority of the time i say i read a book i really mean i listened to the audiobook. i like to listen to audiobooks when i do household chores. with the weather warming up here in minnesota, i've been doing my spring cleaning â€“ deep cleaning the kitchen and bathrooms, cleaning and storing my winter clothes, bringing out the summer clothes, and getting ready to start gardening. this gave me plenty of time to get through these two large books in the space of a week.</p><img src="/microblog/images/ageofvice.jpg" alt="cover of the book Age of Vice by Deepti Kapoor" style="float: left; padding: 1em 1em 1em 0;max-width:50%;"><p><em>cw: mentions of drugs, violence, car crashes, and death</em> i don't remember why i decided to read <b>age of vice</b>. to be honest like 80% of the books i read i just see on libby or hoopla, think the cover looks good or the short blurb sounds interesting, then put it on hold. so by the time i'm actually able to check it out and read it i've forgotten all about what drew me to it in the first place. it follows the story of sunny wadia, the heir to a powerful mobster family, his servant ajay, and his journalist girlfriend neda. the book starts with a car crash that kills five people in new dehli, seemingly caused by ajay. not really the story i typically reach for, since i mainly read fantasy, but i've been on a bit of a crime thriller kick the last couple of months so i'm guessing this is why i put it on hold like 3 months ago. soon we go back to ajay's childhood and spend like a third of the book going through his past, how he meets sunny and starts to work for him, and gradually come to understand the wadia family from the perspective of an outsider. i loved this part of the book â€“ i found ajay and his journey so captivating. but when the perspective moved to neda is when the book started to lose me. a journalist getting involved with the playboy son of a violent gang family, who is being investigated by the newspaper she works at, sounds like it should be interesting, but she ends up being the most boring character in the book. i don't know how to describe her other than she feels like she was written by a man, but the author is a woman, so... it's like she has no interiority. not that any of the other characters do either but i felt like she had the most potential, just to end up being defined entirely by her relationship to a man. and the man is fucking sunny wadia. even after all the time i spent watching her become interested in and then falling in love with him, i couldn't find a single redeeming quality to him. honestly he seemed cooler when i was reading from ajay's perspective. like if it was revealed at some point that ajay was in love with sunny i would've been like "okay, i could see how he could develop those feelings given his life circumstances" but neda? girl... love yourself. by the time we switch to sunny's perspective for the last third i was basically entirely checked out at that point. really the only reason i didn't DNF was because i was still invested in ajay's downward spiral. like while ajay was dealing with the trauma of trying to reunite with the family he lost as a child and the increasing level of violence he was expected to perform as part of his duties, sunny's downward spiral was just... drinking more and doing more cocaine. groundbreaking. the final parts of the book that take place after the reader learns the truth of the car crash was just confusing to me. i think i would've had an easier time if i was reading and not listening to the audiobook, but i absolutely would've DNF'd by that point if i was actually reading it. i've also read other reviews that mention feeling lost in the last part too, so maybe it's not just a me thing. besides ajay, the only other thing i really liked about this book was the prose. i think the blunt, detached air of it was fitting for the atmosphere of the book.</p><img src="/microblog/images/invisiblewomen.jpg" alt="cover of the book Invisible Women by caroline criado pÃ©rez" style="float: right; padding: 1em 0em 1em 1em;max-width:50%;"><p>i've had <b>invisible women</b> in my to read list for awhile now. the book discusses how women are often not considered when it comes to collecting data on basically every facet of life. the author claims that this arises from how we consider men to be the default human, with words like "man" and "mankind" being understood to include women, so people often assume that conclusions drawn from men's opinions or studies using mostly men will apply to women too; pÃ©rez goes on to show just how pervasive this mindset is and how it's actually inaccurate at best and actively harmful at worst. i think i didn't read this book earlier because i wasn't sure if i was in the mood to read about stuff i assumed i was pretty knowledgeable about already. and i was right, that i didn't learn a ton of new information from this book, but i do read a fair bit of feminist literature. since i just needed something to listen to while i cleaned, it didn't bore me though. the audiobook is read by the author and you can definitely feel her frustration at points which i personally liked, although i've read some reviews that disliked it. to me the most interesting chapters were the final ones, that discuss how women aren't included in disaster relief planning and that this leads to prioritizing rebuilding for businesses before public housing, walkability and safe transit, and mixed use areas that women are more likely to want and utilize. it's not something that i had ever thought of before, how even zoning laws and city planning are disproportionately affect women.</p><img src="/microblog/images/20240404sweater.jpeg" alt="lilac mock neck drop sleeve cropped cashmere sweater" style="float: left; padding: 1em 1em 1em 0;max-width:30%;"><p>in addition to doing a bunch of cleaning and listening to audiobooks i also <span class="hashtag">#thrifted</span> this sweater. it's a cashmere sweater in a pretty lilac color by the brand theory. i'm not that familiar with fashion but i thought i had heard the name before, plus most of the cashmere sweaters i've thrifted have been from charter club or j crew in boring cuts. so when i saw this sweater in a bit of a trendier style and color i was a bit curious as to how much it would retail for. turns out the original price was <a target="_blank" href="https://outlet.theory.com/cropped-mock-neck-sweater-in-cashmere/L0718702.html">$325</a> ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it makes me feel better for spending 7 whole dollars on it despite the weird patch of pilling on the front.</p></div>
