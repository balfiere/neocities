    <div class="message"><p style="text-indent:0;"> <span class="hashtag">#languagelearning</span> <span class="hashtag">#played</span> <span class="hashtag">#japanese</span> </p><p>have any other language learners noticed just how much ai has infiltrated language learning spaces‚Ä¶ i feel like i'm probably beating a dead horse here bc damn near everybody in this neighborhood of the internet doesn't agree with genAI, but i've gotten so used to others sharing my convictions that every time i wander outside this bubble i'm always shocked at how much some people use it. and not just use it ‚Äî <em>trust</em> it! and not just for asking it to translate an idiom or slang not found in dictionaries here and there. i've seen people unironically suggesting others use chatgpt and other llms to:</p><ul><li>generate an entire anki deck</li><li>generate short stories to read</li><li>have written or spoken practice conversations</li><li>translate and break down entire passages (before attempting to read it themselves and only asking for help on parts they don't understand)</li><li>generate example sentences for a target word or phrase that they found in their immersion or in the wild to add to their anki deck (instead of just‚Ä¶ adding the original native sentence they found the word in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶)</li></ul><p>and the damn apps‚Ä¶ i swear every other day i see someone advertising their new language learning app that's basically just chatgpt/claude/gemini etc w a custom prompt. now i'm not a software dev so i may be misunderstanding something but‚Ä¶ what's the point.</p><p>really, what's the point of using llms so extensively to learn a language. it all just seems so inefficient. like after spending 15 minutes setting up yomitan or goldendict i can look up a word or phrase in multiple different dictionaries before chatgpt even loads, then if i so choose add them to my anki deck with the original context and native audio in the time it would take to prompt chatgpt for a definition. on top of that llms love making shit up so u still need to fact check it, by checking a dictionary, asking a native speaker, etc. and it's like at that point why go through the bother of generating cards in the first place? but still i see people swear up and down that the text llms produce are correct and error free. well i'm happy ur so confident in ur own ability to assess bullshit in ur target language (not that they actually can), but the beginners u keep suggesting ur methods to aren't going to know how to. and even when it is technically correct, when i've tested llms in thai to see where these people are coming from, it just fails to produce the idiomatic, slang-filled, sometimes messy but still authentic speech.</p><p>and that's really my biggest issue with all this. i always thought the whole reason to learn a new language was to understand people. humans. who make art and write stories and fight and cry and laugh together. to connect to people who may be from a different culture but who still understand our shared humanity. the joy of learning a language is gaining access to the thoughts and feelings of a whole new group of people u couldn't before, to hear their stories‚Ä¶ why waste what precious time we have on this earth reading the words of a mere facsimile? what's the point of learning a language if most of ur time with it is a version processed by a machine and not the version of it that lives and breathes in this world? i think these people are going to be in for a rude awakening call when they try to interact with their target language outside of the english-ified slop their favorite llm feeds them and the pleasantries exchanged with the waitress at their local cafe. if these people want to hinder their own ability to understand the authentic speech of their target language in the long run then so be it, but it kills me to think that a beginner might follow their advice or download an app that's just ai in disguise without really thinking about the implications of it.</p><p>rant aside‚Ä¶ in other news i started my first otome game in japanese, <b>ayakashi gohan</b>. i've played a couple other, shorter visual novels in japanese but this is the first otome game and first what i would personally consider "full length" (30-40+ hrs native speed) VN. i was gonna wait to post my thoughts on it until after i finished but i had the biggest jump scare playing this game that i just HAD to post about: kuroda takaya voices one of the route antagonists.</p><figure class="large"><img src="/microblog/images/20250801ayakashigohan1.jpg" /><figcaption><audio controls preload="metadata"><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/7hlrqa.ogg" type="audio/ogg" /><source src="https://files.catbox.moe/ur5tdf.mp3" type="audio/mp3" /></audio><br />‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„Åè„Å©„ÅÑ„ÄÇ‰ø∫„ÅØ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊ±∫„ÇÅ„Åü„ÄÇ„ÅÇ„ÅÆÂ®ò‰ª•Â§ñ„ÅØËÄÉ„Åà„Çâ„Çå„Çì<br/>Enough.

Sakura looks surprised and Tomoyo has a gentle smile on her face."><p>i also read and watched the sequel <b>cardcaptor sakura: clear card</b>. even though i loved ccs as a kid i never read the sequel, probably because i was in college when the series started and wasn't into animanga at the time. luckily though the manga is finished now and i was able to binge read the whole thing ^^ i didn't really have high hopes since i don't usually care for series reboots, but i enjoyed it a lot more than i thought i would. i liked that sakura was better able to take charge of situations and leap into action, and syaoran got some moments to show off too. tomoyo and kero were just as adorable as always of course. while i think the main new character, akiho, was a little underutilized and i would've liked her more if she had a personality that wasn't the same as sakura's (i also could've used more touya and yukito tbh), i think the main mystery of <i>clear card</i> was more interesting than the original series and i like how it expanded upon some of the lore (especially around sakura's parents). i read that last year CLAMP announced a sequel to the first season after 5 years but i couldn't find any follow up. the anime had some major changes from the manga that i'm not sure how they're going to deal with in the sequel, but tbh i know i'll be happy as long as i get to see sakura and syaoran animated together again (i may have teared up when they flew together towards the end of the first season...). here are some of my favorite panels (spoiler warning):</p><p style="clear:both;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center; flex-flow: column wrap;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240615clearcard4.webp" alt="a manga cap of Sakura from the manga Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card.
