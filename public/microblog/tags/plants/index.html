(mild spoilers for fated memories + 1926 below) i think i liked this sequel a little more than the first game, if only for the alternative + henri route. i love when otome games that have a lot of death in them also have an "everyone lives" route afterwards, and with the alternative route in this game i liked seeing how the LIs interact with the MC when they spend a long period of time being her friend/acquaintance before trying to get with her. especially with dante and nicola, i ended up liking them way more on their alternative route vs. their original route in the first game. legit if dante ever gave lili shooting lessons in his OG route like he does in his alternative route he probably would've ended up being my fav 😪 also i loved seeing the LIs spend more time working together since it meant more time spent bullying yang instead of trying to kill him &lt;3</p><p style="clear:both;display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center; flex-flow: column wrap;"><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p1.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p2.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p3.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p4.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p5.opti.jpg" /><img src="/microblog/images/20240828p6.opti.jpg" /></p><img src="/microblog/images/20240828cardigan.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em; max-width: 30%;" alt="a panel of a cardigan, partially knitted. the piece features many cables." /><p>this month i also worked a lot on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/folklore-cardigan-4">folklore cardigan</a>. i started this in february and had it in storage for like… 5 months… but i finally decided to get it done and now i just have the back piece left. it's the first wearable i've ever knitted and i made a lot of modifications, so hopefully it comes together alright. the yarn is from a cardigan i bought at a thrift store and unraveled, and i was worried that i wouldn't have enough yarn but i think it'll be enough. i managed to thrift and unravel two more sweaters this summer, so i'm excited to get this done and start working on the projects i have in mind for them.</p></div>
