      <ul>
        <li>learning a language, especially to a high level, isn't so much as hard as it is extremely time consuming. i like to spend at least 1.5 hours a day studying per language to see growth at a rate that feels rewarding but doesn't drain me too much.</li>
        <li>the most important tip for learning a language is the simplest yet hardest to actually do: study every day! you'll see more progress if you spend 30 minutes every day with your language compared to just studying 3 hours once a week. it's also easier to stick to a routine you do every day as opposed to once a week, and building a routine you can actually stick to consistently and for a long time is the single most important part of learning a language.</li>
        <li>i've found it beneficial to study much more intensely when i'm starting a new language. when you're just starting out, you forget things so fast that it can seem like you're forgetting faster than you can learn and you know so little that you can't really do anything interesting. i spent the first couple weeks studying 4-8 hours a day getting comfortable with the writing system and sounds of the language, basic grammar, and the couple hundred most common words so i'd have a solid footing and can get onto more fun studying methods.</li>
        <li>i don't recommend being a beginner at two languages at the same time for the reasons explained above. i recommend picking the one you're more interested and getting to an advanced beginner/lower intermediate level first before starting the next language. personally i only started studying japanese when most of my time 'studying' thai consisted of watching and understanding enough to enjoy native content like vlogs and tv.</li>
        <li>despite all i've written so far, it's important to recognize your limits and consider your goals when building a routine. while much of my opinions on language learning is with the goal of reaching a high level of fluency, there's nothing wrong with only wanting to learn enough to get by on vacation or impressing your in-laws. if you have no need to write in your target language, you don't have to spend a bunch of time writing; my mom has been living in america for over 20 years and can still barely write in english but she's able to get by just fine without it. there's also no such thing as learning too slow – i know the internet and social media is full of people claiming to have passed N1 in a year or getting conversationally fluent in like 3 months but you don't have to compare your success to theirs. many of these people are purposely misrepresenting their ability for views anyways, and in any case their life and their reasons for learning a language are different than yours so what does it matter?</li>
        <li>find ways of making learning as fun as possible! try to find stuff on topics you enjoy or are interested in that match your level. for example, some of the first native content i watched in thai were vegan cooking videos since a) i'm vegan and love making random vegan food and b) cooking videos are highly visual, so even if you can't understand every word they're saying you can still follow along and enjoy the content. recently i've been rewatching animes i'd seen as a child like cardcaptor sakura and sailor moon with japanese subtitles and it's been a ton of fun!</li>

        <p>i've been studying thai since late 2021 and i'd say i'm intermediate or so. i'm something of a heritage speaker as my mother is thai, however before i started studying i really only knew the numbers 1-10 and how to ask where the bathroom is lmao. the following is an overview of my routine over the years plus my reflections on it. it's probably not the best method but maybe you'll learn something from my journey.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>i started with learning the new sounds and script. i highly recommend avoiding romanization since there are multiple different romanization systems and they all kinda suck as there's a lot of sounds present in thai that don't exist in english. i did a lot of writing practice and made flashcards by hand since i feel like writing helps familiarize oneself with new shapes better than digital flashcards. i followed the resources i have linked on my <a href="resources/language/thai/index.html">thai resources</a> page under "reading".</li>
          <li>once i felt like i had a decent grasp on the script i went through the spoken world thai book that my mom bought for me like 10 years ago. for each lesson i added each word to anki</li>
