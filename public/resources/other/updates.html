      <p><b>4/3/2024:</b> added reading section to japanese resources and applications section to language learning tools section.</p>

      <p><b>3/28/2024:</b> okay i think i have something on every page now! i still have more links i wanna add to the japanese and more links sections but this should have most of my favorite sites now ðŸ¥³</p>

      <p><b>3/20/2024:</b> made the site responsive and (hopefully) mobile friendly. i wanna redo how the links are displayed eventually but it should be serviceable for now. i also added dark mode support.</p>

      <p><b>3/17/2024:</b> made each section on a page collapsible, hopefully it should help navigation on longer pages like my thai resources page and (eventually) my japanese page.</p>

      <p><b>3/15/2024:</b> added a landing page! for when i inevitably make a personal site, so ppl can go straight to one or the other. decided to make to make it nana themed, it took FOREVER (2 days) to code but i think it looks p cute?! i also started adding gaming links here, i should be done adding them over the next week or so.</p>

      <p><b>3/13/2024:</b> my thai page is basically done at this point and i've put in my most used japanese resources, although i still have more i want to add. i learned that one of my favorite thai language learning sites that i hadn't visited in awhile, aakanee, is down .Â·Â´Â¯`(>â–‚<)Â´Â¯`Â·. luckily the wayback machine seemed to have archived all the files and stuff i checked but it was a good reminder of one of my goals with this site â€“ to archive my favorite resources and share my backups with others!</p>
       
      <p><b>3/9/2024:</b> created this site today! i've been thinking about making a site like this for awhile now, to organize my favorite bookmarks related to language learning and game emulation, roms, etc and sharing it with others. after the recent loss of citra, yuzu, and tachiyomi, i decided it was finally time to make this site and share links to my own archives and backups of my favorite programs at risk of being taken down. eventually i want to add a personal page and maybe a yakuza shrine? if i can get better at coding...</p>
