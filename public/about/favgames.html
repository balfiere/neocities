    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>final fantasy xii</h2>my favorite game of all time!! amazingly rich world building and the best implementation of the atb system in the series. the world is fun to explore, there's lots of side content to do that's actually enjoyable, the english dub is phenomenal, and i loved the more subtle, politically driven story.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/y7.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>yakuza 7</h2>amazing narrative and cast of characters more than makes up for its less than stellar combat system. ichiban i would die for you</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/p2ep.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>persona 2: eternal punishment</h2>by far my favorite persona game and its not even close. my favorite cast of characters in any video game. this game + yakuza 7 made me wish there were way more jrpgs with adult main characters where adulthood was a major theme in the game ðŸ¤§ also why does the ending song go so hard</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/ffviii.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>final fantasy viii</h2>my very first jrpg! i related way too much to squall as a kid and this game did irreversible psychological damage to me because of it. even now i still wear a griever necklace like the one squall has. has my favorite video game soundtrack.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/tgaa.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>the great ace attorney</h2>i love og aa and don't rly like historical fiction so i didn't know how to feel about this game going in but kazuma and barok van zieks immediately stole my heart ðŸ˜­ðŸ’–</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/judgment.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>judgment</h2>i love japanese crime fiction and i love yakuza so this game was like tailor made for me. i loved getting to see kamurocho from a civilian's perspective too.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/y4.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>yakuza 4</h2>my favorite yakuza game. has my favorite version of kamurocho, i loved the verticality to it and it has a vibe to it that reminds me of the ps2. i know the plot gets a lot of flak but i just loved saejima's and taniumura's personal journey in this game, especially as someone who started with 0 and had to play through three other games to finally meet saejima.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/trails3rd.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>trails in the sky the 3rd</h2>another game where i loved the first few games in the series so was unsure about the protagonist+setting shift, but i actually ended up loving the dungeon crawler, townless structure of this game. also KEVIN GRAHAM ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/jackjeanne.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>jack jeanne</h2>i cried A LOT playing this game, it's not even sad i was just so touched by everyone's relationship with each other and how they all learned to rely on one another. i loved the true ending, even if it was a massive pain in the ass to unlock.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/soulhackers.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>devil summoner: soul hackers</h2>vibes of this game are unmatched and video game design peaked with dual screen megaten games. play this game if you love the late 90s cyber aesthetic.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/ffxv.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>final fantasy xv</h2>i know everyone hates this game but the cast of characters and just being able to chill and go camping makes the ending really hit for me. also i think the combat system is more fun that most old school final fantasy's but i am an atb hater. so.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/trailszero.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>the legend of heroes: trails from zero</h2>i was sooooo hesitant to move on from the trails in the sky cast but damn if the SSS didn't deliver. also i think the hub style layout with crossbell at the center helped to establish a strong connection to the world earlier on than in the sky trilogy.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/kh3582.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>kingdom hearts 358/2 days</h2>i actually started kingdom hearts as a kid with a copy of kingdom hearts 2 that i checked out at the library randomly one day, and i think i've had a bit of a roxas bias because of it ever since. so playing this game and seeing his backstory really destroyed me when i was 12 lol</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/y0v2.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>yakuza 0</h2>if i could erase my memories of any one game to replay it anew it would hands down be this one. i started playing the series with this game, going in without knowing anything at all and was absolutely blindsided by how much i fell in love with the setting and the plot. best $5 i have ever spent</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/digitaldevilsaga.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>digital devil saga</h2>megaten with an actually interesting plot... nah but fr even though i thought the "twist" was pretty obvious it still managed to keep me hooked. also the combat and mantra system were more than fun enough to make up for the lack of demon recruitment and fusion system.</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/tloztp.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>the legend of zelda: twilight princess</h2>another game with a ton of nostalgic value for me. i was definitely a wolf girlie when i was a kid so this game was inevitably a favorite of mine. also the motion controls were so much fun to me even if my shield attack never worked</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/lj.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>lost judgment</h2>i like the first game's plot a little more but this game has my favorite combat system of any action game. i spent sooooo much time just skateboarding around ijincho and beating up teenagers that sometimes i forgot what was going on in the story lol. i also loved the school stories and the kaito files</div>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/games/mysticmessenger.avif" class="image">
    <div class="middle">
        <div class="text"><h2>mystic messenger</h2>i don't think i've ever been as obsessed about a game as i was playing this game when it came out in 2017. i spent the entirety of my freshman year of college setting up alarms (no ringing, just buzzing so i wouldn't wake up my roommate) to get to all the chatrooms and i bought the unlimited phone card so i could call all my boys after every chat ðŸ™ˆ</div>
