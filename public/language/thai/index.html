        <dd>book that teaches you how to read the thai script. i love the way it organizes and teaches you consonants, vowels, class, tone rules, exceptions, etc – i tried and failed learning to read thai a number of times but this book made it all 'click' for me. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSlxdPc9Y1J2bTWKUYseiqjnd4BjmS2_/view?usp=drive_link">epub</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SUgCkb58jaKs5ORrp99P_K0keYXX3CnK/view?usp=sharing">azw3</a>; also on z-lib. find the audio for this book <a href="https://readthailanguage.com/getaudio/">here</a>.</dd>

        <dd>website made by an expat living in thailand. the section linked above is the best resource i've seen for learning the phonology (sounds) of thai. explains sounds unfamiliar to english speakers such as ป, ต, and −ือ clearly and in language accessible to those unfamiliar with linguistics. i found the spectrograms to illustrate the five tones as well as the difference between ป and บ to be particularly helpful.</dd>

        <p>honestly i don't think the textbooks available for thai are all that great since they're typically aimed at tourists, rely on romanization, and don't get that advanced especially compared to what's available for more popular languages. here are the ones that i used when i was just starting out, but i don't recommend you treat them like college textbooks and spend like sixth months going through it – just pick one and get some basic vocab and grammar down.</p><br />

        <dd>teaches basic vocabulary and grammar over the course of 15 lessons. i recommend being able to read thai before starting this book, although there are romanizations. comes with culture notes, reading and dialogue practice, and comprehension questions. i've uploaded the audio <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZRypqG6NCRfQ5hlZp-JJurkHa6tJCgz?usp=sharing">here</a>.</dd>

        <dd>teaches basic vocabulary and grammar over the course of 17 lessons. the above link goes to an archive.org copy where you can 'check out' the whole book for an hour at a time. the audio for this book can be found <a href="https://library.teachyourself.com/id004325066">here</a> for free; an anki deck for this book can be found <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1713273983">here</a>.</dd>

        <dd>interactive website and app. it's organized similar to a textbook with major units broken up into smaller chapters, but also has a vocab flashcard SRS system built into it. it was free through my local library; you can check if yours carries it through the link above.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://thai-notes.com/FSITLC/index.html">FSI Thai Language Course</a></dt>
        <dd>website that has taken the Foreign Service Institute's thai language course and converted it to text to make it more accessible to modern learners. there's a lot of audio and it's embedded right where it's needed, you can toggle IPA transcription on or off, and is much more thorough than other courses i've seen. however it was made in 1970 and is definitely showing its age, plus it was designed for 8 hours a day of in-person drilling and instruction so there's not much in the way of self study exercises.</dd>

          <dd>best thai-english dictionary on the net imo. you can choose your romanization system or turn it off completely, there are a ton of example sentences, and most words have native audio. i like that you can browse words by categories, and they have a good amount of thai slang although nothing super modern. definitely check out their reference section too, they have some interesting pages on more obscure and advanced features of the language.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://lingopolo.org/thai/">lingopolo</a></dt>
          <dd>website with a ton of example sentences with native audio. has a built in flashcard system, but they can only reviewed by lesson (in blocks of like 10 or so) so i recommend using anki instead.</dd>
          <dt><a href="https://thai-notes.com/index.html">thai-notes</a></dt>
          <dd>website with a variety of tools related to learning thai. i've already linked to the two i find most useful, their FSI course and their Mary Haas readers, but they have some other cool stuff like in browser games and a classifier dictionary.</dd>
