        <dd>book that teaches you how to read the thai script. i love the way it organizes and teaches you consonants, vowels, class, tone rules, exceptions, etc – i tried and failed learning to read thai a number of times but this book made it all 'click' for me. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSlxdPc9Y1J2bTWKUYseiqjnd4BjmS2_/view?usp=drive_link">epub</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SUgCkb58jaKs5ORrp99P_K0keYXX3CnK/view?usp=sharing">azw3</a>; also on z-lib. find the audio for this book <a href="https://readthailanguage.com/getaudio/">here</a>.</dd>

        <dd>website made by an expat living in thailand. the section linked above is the best resource i've seen for learning the phonology (sounds) of thai. explains sounds unfamiliar to english speakers such as ป, ต, and −ือ clearly and in language accessible to those unfamiliar with linguistics. i found the spectrograms to illustrate the five tones as well as the difference between ป and บ to be particularly helpful.</dd>

        <p>honestly i don't think the textbooks available for thai are all that great since they're typically aimed at tourists, rely on romanization, and don't get that advanced especially compared to what's available for more popular languages. here are the ones that i used when i was just starting out, but i don't recommend you treat them like college textbooks and spend like sixth months going through it – just pick one and get some basic vocab and grammar down.</p><br />

        <dd>teaches basic vocabulary and grammar over the course of 15 lessons. i recommend being able to read thai before starting this book, although there are romanizations. comes with culture notes, reading and dialogue practice, and comprehension questions. i've uploaded the audio <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aZRypqG6NCRfQ5hlZp-JJurkHa6tJCgz?usp=sharing">here</a>.</dd>

        <dd>teaches basic vocabulary and grammar over the course of 17 lessons. the above link goes to an archive.org copy where you can 'check out' the whole book for an hour at a time. the audio for this book can be found <a href="https://library.teachyourself.com/id004325066">here</a> for free; an anki deck for this book can be found <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1713273983">here</a>.</dd>

        <dd>interactive website and app. it's organized similar to a textbook with major units broken up into smaller chapters, but also has a vocab flashcard SRS system built into it. it was free through my local library; you can check if yours carries it through the link above.</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://thai-notes.com/FSITLC/index.html">FSI Thai Language Course</a></dt>
        <dd>website that has taken the Foreign Service Institute's thai language course and converted it to text to make it more accessible to modern learners. there's a lot of audio and it's embedded right where it's needed, you can toggle IPA transcription on or off, and is much more thorough than other courses i've seen. however it was made in 1970 and is definitely showing its age, plus it was designed for 8 hours a day of in-person drilling and instruction so there's not much in the way of self study exercises.</dd>

          <dd>youtube channel of with thousands of hours of ALG style videos. designed to be used without any other traditional study methods, just watch the videos and acquire the language naturally. you can read a simpler explanation of the method <a href="https://www.dreamingspanish.com/method">here</a> or watch more in depth videos discussing ALG <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgdZTyVWfUhlcP3Wj__xgqWpLHV0bL_JA">here</a>. i personally use this channel as listening practice alongside sentence mining for the bulk of my thai language learning.</dd>

          <dd>youtube channel of kruu ying, another one of the teachers on comprehensible thai. she has some beginner content, although most of it is meant for more intermediate learners. i personally really love her videos where she discusses thai slang, culture, news, etc with kruu fah.</dd>

          <dd>best thai-english dictionary on the net imo. you can choose your romanization system or turn it off completely, there are a ton of example sentences, and most words have native audio. i like that you can browse words by categories, and they have a good amount of thai slang although nothing super modern. definitely check out their reference section too, they have some interesting pages on more obscure and advanced features of the language.</dd>
